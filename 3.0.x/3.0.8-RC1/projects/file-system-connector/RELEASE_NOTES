Release 3.0.8, 12 April 2013
============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 7684717: Files incorrectly inherit list folder contents permission.
               List folder permissions grants read access to a folder and
               its sub-folders, but it should not grant read access to the
               files contained within those folders.

Issue 8511258: In a newly configured File system connector with Disable
               Traversal option selected, the Disable Traversal option
               was not respected.


Release 3.0.6, 04 March 2013
============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of version 3.0.0, 3.0.2, or 3.0.4 are strongly
encouraged to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 7355081: File System Connector did not support hidden file shares.
               SMB "Administrative Shares" (those whose name end in '$') are
               marked "hidden".  Even though the connector explicitly
               excludes hidden files and files under hidden directories, the
               connector now allows the user to specify a hidden start path.

Issue 7418773: If a connection to the file server was lost, the JCIFS session
               and transport layers were left in an inconsistent state. This
               would result in nearly all subsequent requests throwing either
               NT_STATUS_NOT_FOUND or "The parameter is incorrect" exceptions,
               which would halt traversal. This release includes a new 
               jcifs.jar which has been patched to retry broken connections.

Issue 7577675: Localization strings were improperly escaped in JavaScript for
               the connector configuration form.

Issue 7690736: Inherit-only ACEs should appear in an ACL associated with the
               parent directory, not the child.  We were folding Inherit-only
               ACEs from the parent onto the child.  Consequently, if the
               parent ACE changed, that change would not be reflected in the
               child's copy.

Issue 7690993 (Code Site Issue 41): CopySmbToLocalDisk leaked Input/Output
               Streams if exceptions are thrown when copying files.  This
               could cause the process to run out of memory.

Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:
webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.


Release 3.0.4, 19 November 2012
===============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of version 3.0.0 or 3.0.2 are strongly encouraged
to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
               Improve an error message in the admin console when the
               traversal user has no access rights on the file share.

Issue 7369489: Remove an unused AceSecurityLevel check from SmbAclBuilder.
               Update AceSecurityLevel comment in advanced config to make
               clear that the property is not used when inherited ACLs are
               enabled with GSA 7.0.

Issue 7383538: SmbAclBuilder.isReadAce() should include Generic access rights.
               The connector now recognizes ACE.GENERIC_ALL and ACE.GENERIC_READ
               as valid read access rights.

Issue 7386939: Feed namespaces and case-insensitive ACLs to GSA 7.x, even if
               inherited ACLs are not being used.

Issue 7430175: Lister and retriever threads cause a deadlock. Fixed a deadlock
               problem in JCIFS when used with DFS.
               
Manual upgrade instructions
---------------------------
Note that this release includes a new jcifs.jar, which in addition to the new
connector-filesystem.jar, should be copied to the Tomcat deployment directory:
webapps/connector-manager/WEB-INF/lib.


Release 3.0.2, 17 October 2012
==============================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of version 3.0.0 are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 7166051: Deny HTTP HEAD requests from legacy authorization, which would
               always permit access to secure documents.
Issue 7291282: Connector did not feed the Windows "NT AUTHORITY" groups
               "Authenticated Users" and "Interactive".
Issue 7291526: Connector feeds "inherit-from parent" ACLs, even if file does
               not inherit ACLs from its parent.
Issue 7307947: Connector may skip some explicit ACEs when inherited ACEs
               are present.
Issue 7309510: Connector root directory ACL includes inherit-only ACEs.
Issue 7343330: NullPointerException thrown when closing SmbFileInputStream.


Release 3.0.0, 03 October 2012
==============================

Introduction
------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 is a significant re-engineering of the
connector implementation. 

The most notable improvements are:
  - The connector moves from a Diffing Connector model to a Lister/Retriever
    model. This is a major architectural change for the connector.
  - Vastly improved feed and indexing performance.
  - Support for ACL inheritance and deny for SMB file systems.
  - The connector is now aware of the Traversal Schedule.
  - Upgraded third party components to JCIFS v1.3.17 and MimeUtil v2.1.2.

File system connector version 3.0.0 requires Connector Manager version 3.0.0.
For information about manually upgrading an earlier file system connector
installation to version 3.0.0, please see:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-file-system/wiki/UpgradeToVersion3

Lister/Retriever Conversion
---------------------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 uses a Lister/Retriever model to feed
documents to the Google Search Appliance.  Rather than pushing a Content feed
to the GSA, the Lister pushes a Metadata-and-URL feed, where the URL (referred
to as the ContentURL) points back to the connector's document content Retriever.
The document content is then fetched by the GSA using the ContentURL.  Since the
document content is no longer contained within the feed itself, the feeds are
much smaller.

Another benefit to the Lister/Retriever model is the responsibility for 
document change detection moves from the connector to the search appliance,
which uses HTTP "If-Modified-Since" request header to conditionally retrieve
changed content.  This change simplifies the connector implementation
considerably, removing its dependence on the "Diffing Connector" infrastructure.

As a result of the move away from the Diffing Connector infrastructure,
the "queueSize" Advanced Configuration option has been deprecated, and
will be ignored if set.

Google recommends that you use GSA version 6.14 Patch 2 or later, for improved
"If-Modified-Since" handling and Flexible Authorization support.

For improved document security, use HTTPS communications between the 
GSA and the Tomcat web application server hosting the connector. See:
http://code.google.com/p/google-enterprise-connector-manager/wiki/SettingUpHTTPS

ACL Namespaces, ACL Inheritance, and Deny ACLs
----------------------------------------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 supports Access Control Lists (ACLs)
that may be inherited from a parent folder or file share.  This reduces the
number of files/directories that must be re-indexed as a result of an ACL 
change to a folder far up the directory hierarchy.

This version of the file system connector also supports Deny ACLs - ACLs which
deny access to specific individuals or groups.

The file system connector also supports local and global namespaces
for ACL users and groups.

Note GSA version 7.0 or newer is required to support ACL namespaces, 
inheritance, and Deny ACLs.  The file system connector only supports ACLs
for SMB file systems at this time.

Default User and Group ACL Formats Have Changed
-----------------------------------------------
The default ACL format changed between file system connector version 2.x and 
version 3.0.0.  The new default user ACL format is "domain\user".  The new 
default group ACL format is "domain\group".  These new defaults will be the
most appropriate formats to use with GSA version 7.0 and later.  The previous
ACL formats, "user" and "group" (without the domain), are unlikely to work with
GSA version 7.0.  If the Authentication mechanism for this connector returns a
domain element, then the user and group ACLs must also include the domain.

If you have previously explicitly configured the user and group ACL formats
in the Advanced Configuration, that explicit configuration will still be
honored (although you may wish to change it if upgrading the GSA as well).
If you have not explicitly configured the user and group ACL formats, the
new default format will be used.

If, when using file system connector version 3.0.0, you wish to use the
unadorned "user" and "group" formats, you must explicitly enable those
formats in the Advanced Configuration.

Traversal Schedule Aware
------------------------
The file system connector version 3.0.0 is aware of the Traversal Schedule,
including scheduled traversal intervals, Retry Delay, and run-once traversals
(Retry Delay of -1).  Previous versions of the connector ignored the Traversal
Schedule, continually scanning the repository outside of the traversal 
intervals.  Older versions of the connector also ignored the Retry Delay, 
replicating its functionality with advanced configuration options.

Since the connector is now aware of the Traversal Schedule, the
"delayBetweenTwoScansInMillis" and "introduceDelayAfterEveryScan" advanced 
configuration options are now deprecated and will be ignored if set.

The Retry Delay governs the delay between traversals of the repository.
Most traversals are incremental traversals and look only for items that have
changed since the last traversal, based upon the file's last-modified timestamp.
Some traversals are full traversals (see below), which feed all appropriate
contents of the repository to the Search Appliance.

The Full Traversal Interval governs the interval between full, rather than
incremental, traversals of the repository.  You may wish to configure the
forced Full Traversal Interval for the needs of your organization.  File
and directory adds and copies and changes to file contents are detected
during the connector's incremental traversals.  However, moved or renamed
files and changes to ACLs and other metadata may only be detected during full
traversals.  Frequent full traversals may overwhelm the Search Appliance,
bogging down its feed processing.  Long full traversal intervals increase the
time it takes for the Search Appliance to notice certain types of changes.

A full traversal may also be triggered manually at any time by resetting 
the connector in the Search Appliance Admin Console.  A full traversal is
automatically triggered if you change the connector's configuration or
schedule, or restart the Tomcat web application server.

If you have a large number of files in your repository (more than 1 million),
the default Retry Delay and Full Traversal Interval values are likely too 
small.  Consider Retry Delay values of hours (4 hours = 240 minutes).
Consider a Full Traversal Interval that is at least 2 days for each million
documents fed.

At this time, the connector ignores the Traversal Rate configuration.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issues 5409517,5453293: File system connector should feed in Deny ACL.
Issue 5833106: File system connector running slowly against DFS.
Issue 6299009: File system connector has multiple issues in crawling when the
               file name has Unicode characters.
Issue 6311078: Onboard file system connector accepts / as Start path and fails
               to crawl it.

Issue 6494509: File system connector ACL case-sensitivity should be
               configurable. ACLs are now case-insensitive by default, and
               can be configured to be case-sensitive by adding a document
               filter bean definition to the file system connector Advanced
               Configuration XML on the connector configuration form:
               <bean class="com.google.enterprise.connector.util.filter.AclPropertyFilter">
                 <property name="caseSensitivityType" value="everything-case-sensitive"/>
               </bean>
Issue 6513826: Add less verbose logging level for MBean messages.
               Raised the level of the javax.management package to SEVERE.

Issue 6530759: Make "domain\username" and "domain\groupname" the default user
               and group name format for file system connector ACL feed option.
Issues 6746600,6867242: Toggling "Disable traversal" check box multiplies the
               file system traversal threads and the connector goes into an
               inconsistent state.
Issue 6779253: Timeouts in file system connector cause it to hang; requires
               restart of Tomcat.
Issue 6929748: File system connector sending duplicates after reset or changes
               to configuration or schedule.
Issue 6977695: File system connector traversal restarts from scratch after
               timeout exception.
Issue 7089492: Full traversal interval has no value when upgrading
               connector from version 2.x to version 3.0.
Issue 7069623: Connector feeds well-known security groups in local namespace.
               This affected the Windows groups "Administrators", "Users",
               "Guests", and "Everyone".


Release 2.8.6, May 4, 2012
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a maintenance release that improves quality without adding any
new functionality. Users of previous releases are encouraged to review
the changes below to determine whether to upgrade.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
Issue 6109697: File system connector throws a NullPointerException and
               halts traversal. The exception may be logged to stdout
               or in catalina.out. This issue was introduced in
               version 2.8.4 and can occur when the traversal user
               does not have permission to read the files in a
               directory.
Issue 5589982: File-system connector fails to crawl Samba share,
               SmbException: 0xC000011F is observed. The problem could
               potentially occur on other SMB implementations, but has
               only been reported on Samba shares.
Issue 5546078: Restart of FileSystem Connector when share is down causes
               exception which halts the traversal. No new content would
               be crawled.

Known limitations:
-----------------
Issue 5237436: File system connector doesn't allow including patterns for selective folders under a file share.
Issue 5111509: File system connector goes into infinite loop when connector is reset. This is reproducible only for
               very small file shares.

Advanced Configuration Properties
---------------------------------

Issues 5734921, 5735103: Do not store access times when
               lastAccessResetFlagForSmb feature is off. This avoids
               a memory leak and performance degradation.
Issue 5806403: Connector sends delete feeds when the share is only
               temporarily available.
Issue 5028655, 6019938: Fix logic bug where recovery-files' age comparison
               was broken.  This could lead to the connector resending the
               same files again after Tomcat was restarted.

Known limitations:
-----------------
Issue 5269133: File system connector is not able to feed pptx file format.
