Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for file systems

The Google Enterprise connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

The Google Enterprise Connector for file systems
enables the appliance to traverse documents and attachments on
a windows share.

The Google Enterprise Connector for file systems 
communicates with the windows server hosting the share with the
JCIFS library (The Java CIFS Client Library).
